## Overview

We have created a full stack social networking app, specifically for alumni of coding bootcamps to stay connected and support each other's journey after graduation.

From technical questions to career related advice as well as the odd engineer meme, this is a great way to build on everything learned and keep in touch with your network.

## User Story

```
- As a graduate or current student of a full stack coding bootcamp, I would like to stay connected with my peers through a dynamic social application.
- When I create a profile, I am prompted to add my name, email, short bio and password of at least 6 characters. There is the option to upload a profile picture & include my github and 3 other social media links.
- After registering, I am redirected to a live feed that shows posts of users that I am following. I can like and comment on these posts and also create my own.
- When creating a post, location and images can be added via file upload.
- To directly message a user, I can search by name to view their profiles and set up a realtime chat.
```
